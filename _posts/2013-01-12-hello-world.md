Some days ago, while biking to work in a cold morning, I realized that 2013 was my 7th year working as a software developer. After thousands of hours of hard work, dozens of apps and countless lessons learned, I've managed to keep working on one of my passions: **code**. I'm happy with this achievement, of course. But after every task completed, after every project succesfully deployed... I always think: **"Was my solution the best possible? How can I improve it?"**. Sometimes the answer is using different tools, or reading how it's done in different languages, or maybe a technique that I didn't know. In summay: **learning**. The problem is that, the more I learn, the more I realize how little I know about this job. So I've decided to start writing my own blog, with some goals in mind:

**Learning about code and technology**. Pet projects, techniques, new libraries... I'm always playing with code and I would like to write about it. The best way to learn about something is trying to explain it to others. I have no fear of showing my ignorance, and the learning process to fight against it.

**Out of my confort zone**. Nothing better to gain perspective than trying different things. For example, I'm not very good expressing myself in english, so... challenge accepted!

**A minimum of one post every two months**. Sounds like a very low number, but I don't want to be too enthusiastic. My bet is to offer quality over quantity, like when I write code.

The blog is powered by Jekyll, a static site generator. The general style of the web is based on Skeleton, a responsive boilerplate. The page is hosted on [GitHub Pages][github_pages]; you can fork the blog from [this public repo][public_repo].
