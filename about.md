Hello! My name is **Rober Martín H**, and I'm a software developer. 

## Background

I completed my Master's degree in computer science at UPV/EHU University of the Basque Country in 2006.
Since then, I've been working as a software developer for different companies from Donostia/San Sebastián and abroad. 
In the fall of 2020 I decided to start working as a **freelance** developer. 
Drop me a line if you are interested and I'll send you my résumé.

## Skills

Through all these years, I have learned how to develop and maintain **cost-effective** systems 
using good practices like testing and clean code.
When writing software, I try to keep it readable and predictable, 
always with the business perspective in mind.

From a technical point of view, the last projects I've been working on look like this:

+ Write the business logic in **PHP**, isolated from specific infrastructure details.
+ **Symfony** as a thin HTTP layer for the business logic.
+ Persist data through an ORM like **Doctrine**.
+ Send/receive events and improve the performance using **Redis**.
+ Cache responses with **Varnish**.
+ Use **Webpack** to compile and optimize **Vue.js** components and **Sass** stylesheets.
+ Unit testing with **PHPUnit**, **Mocha**.
+ Functional testing with **Behat**, **Selenium**, **Cypress.io**.
+ Reproducible work environments using **Docker**.
+ Manage code through **Git**.
+ Automate development/deployment process with **Continuous Integration** (CircleCI, GitHub actions, ...).
+ Scale using the **cloud**: EC2, RDS, S3, CloudFront, CloudFlare, ...
+ And a lot more! Benchmarks, measure code quality, static analysis, code linting...

## Interests

Software is about people, not about machines. Let's talk!
