Hi, my name is **Rober Martín H** and I'm a software developer since **2006**, 
when I completed my computer engineering studies. In 2016 I decided to travel
around the world while working for companies from Donostia/San Sebastián (ESP).

I mostly code in **PHP** and **Javascript**.
I tweet from [@{{ site.author.twitter }}][twitter]. 
You can find me in [LinkedIn][linkendin] too. 
You can also contact me at `{{ site.author.email_personal }}`.
