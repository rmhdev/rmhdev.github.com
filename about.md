---

Hi, my name is **Rober Martín H**. I was born in **1980** and, when i'm not traveling or riding my bike, i code stuff. I started in the development world in **2006**, after completing my computer engineering studies. Now i'm currently living and working in **Donostia/San Sebastián**.

## Skills

I mostly code in **PHP** and **Javascript**, and Symfony is my favorite framework for developing apps. 

## Contact

I tweet from [@rmhdev][twitter]. You can find me in [LinkedIn][linkendin] too. For professional issues please mail me to `{{ site.author.email_pro }}`. For personal stuff you can use `{{ site.author.email_personal }}`.

## This site

I've built this little corner of the interwebs using [Jekyll][jekyll], a static site generator. The general style of the web is based on [Skeleton][skeleton], a responsive boilerplate. The page is hosted on [GitHub Pages][github_pages]; you can [fork the code][fork_me].
